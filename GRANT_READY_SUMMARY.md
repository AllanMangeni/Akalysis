# Making Akalysis Grant-Ready: Strategic Pivot

## The Challenge
We discovered the Akash Network public API doesn't provide lease/cost data through standard endpoints. This could have been a blocker, but we're turning it into an opportunity.

## The Solution: Deployment Monitoring + Smart Estimation

### What We CAN Access ✅
- Real deployment data from `/akash/deployment/v1beta4/deployments/list`
- Resource specifications (CPU, Memory, Storage, GPU)
- Provider information
- Deployment states and timestamps
- Owner addresses

### Our Innovation: Resource-Based Pricing Model
Instead of just showing what APIs give us, we'll build **intelligent cost estimation** using:

1. **Market Rate Benchmarks** (from Akash docs & community)
2. **Provider Pricing Attributes** (on-chain data)
3. **Resource Multipliers** (CPU, RAM, Storage, GPU)
4. **Historical Trends** (track changes over time)

### Why This Actually Makes Us MORE Grant-Worthy

**Before:** Just another data dashboard
**After:** Solving a real problem with innovation

**Value Proposition:**
- Users can estimate costs BEFORE deploying (no official tool does this)
- Compare provider pricing across the network
- Track deployment costs over time
- Get optimization recommendations
- Forecast future spending
